# Compiler Improvement Campaign

Target: accepted Benchmark V2 development headline 550.

Current accepted baseline:
`accept-2026-07-22T18-26-42Z-8565eddc`, canonical headline 513.77. Its
cache covers 300 seeds per budget.

The previous long-form campaign log remains recoverable from repository
history; older material is also under `docs/archive/`. This file now follows
the concise hypothesis/evidence/decision format required by `goal.md`.

## Current mechanism: ballistic launch read

Hypothesis: the short-probe launch read uses the correct discrete free-fall
law, but its constant vertical correction may be slightly miscalibrated for
the six-body-point rider aggregate. The source-default candidate changes
`LAUNCH_VY_OFFSET_PX` from `0.0345` to `0.043`. Boundary: the shared launch
state read only; no case identity or failure-specific behavior.

Mechanism evidence:

- The equal ten-point body+sled aggregate follows the engine's discrete
  ballistic law to floating-point precision in collision-free flight.
- The public six-body aggregate oscillates around that conserved center due
  to articulation.
- Assembly-center and rotation corrections reduced clean-flight coordinate
  error but worsened fitted next-state prediction through the production
  response model.
- Cross-seed state-dependent corrections were unstable and were retired.
- Focused launch-read/ballistic tests pass (37/37).

Retired probe screen:

- baseline 506.24, candidate 500.51;
- delta -5.72, seed-block SE 10.19;
- validity gained 1, lost 2;
- largest loss: shifted pickup progression -249.43.

Canonical cached N=100 comparison (13,200 candidate compiles, zero baseline
compiles):

- headline 512.82 -> 513.79, delta +0.97, seed-block SE 1.03;
- interval [-1.71, +3.65], result inconclusive;
- budgets: 250k +4.81, 500k -0.86, 750k +1.46;
- validity gained 118, lost 100;
- capability -2.74; largest regression was 7s low-air endurance -29.54.

Decision: retire `0.043` and restore `0.0345`. The point estimate was slightly
positive, but not resolved, not uniformly coherent, and came with a material
capability regression. It is not convincing evidence for promotion.

Workflow changes:

- comparisons are arbitrary-N, cache-backed, stateless, and candidate-only;
- the old accounting/certification workflow was removed;
- a cache-prefix validation bug found by N=2 smoke was fixed without
  recompiling candidate rows;
- the separate probe screen was removed: it cost the same 264 candidate
  compiles as canonical N=2, omitted 750k, used a different seed schedule, and
  was directionally misleading here;
- live progress now reports row counts only; canonical scores appear only
  after hierarchical aggregation.
